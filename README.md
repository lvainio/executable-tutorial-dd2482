# DevSecOps Executable Tutorial: SAST with Gosec

Welcome to the DevSecOps tutorial on **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** using **Gosec**!

## Overview

This tutorial provides an introduction to SAST and demonstrates how to use Gosec, a security tool for the Go programming language. You will learn how to identify security vulnerabilities in your code and how to integrate Gosec with GitHub Actions for automated scanning.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand what SAST is and its significance in DevSecOps.
- Learn how to use Gosec to scan for security vulnerabilities.
- Discover how to integrate Gosec with GitHub Actions for continuous security monitoring.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Follow the installation guide to set up Gosec on your local machine.
2. **Usage:** Explore various use cases to understand Gosec's capabilities.
3. **Integration:** Learn how to automate security scans using GitHub Actions.

## Motivation

Integrating security into your development workflow early can save time and reduce costs. SAST tools like Gosec provide an automated way to detect vulnerabilities before they escalate, ensuring secure and efficient deployments.
