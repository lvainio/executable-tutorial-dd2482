Welcome to this DevSecOps tutorial on *static application security testing* ([SAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing)) with [Gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec).

# Intended Learning Outcomes

In this tutorial you will learn:

- What SAST is, why it is used, and how it can be used to automatically identify security vulnerabilities in a DevSecOps workflow.

- How to use the SAST tool *Gosec*, designed for the Go programming language.

- How to integrate *Gosec* with GitHub Actions.

Before starting the tutorial we will first give some background information on SAST and *Gosec*, followed by a motivation. 

The first part of the tutorial will then cover installation of *Gosec*. You will then be guided through various use cases to understand the capabilities of the tool. 

Finally, you will learn how *Gosec* can be integrated with GitHub Actions to automatically scan a GitHub repository for security vulnerabilities when new code is pushed.
