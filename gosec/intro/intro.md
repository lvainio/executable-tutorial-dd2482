# Welcome!

Welcome to this DevSecOps tutorial on *static application security testing* ([SAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing)) with [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec). 

# Indended Learning Outcomes

In this tutorial you will learn what SAST is and why it is important in DevOps workflows to identify security vulnerabilities. You will also learn how to use a SAST tool in order to scan the source code of go projects for security vulnerabilities. We will cover the installation of *gosec* and guide you through different use cases. Finally, you will learn how it can be integrated in a CI workflow using GitHub Actions to automatically scan a project every time a commit is made to the repository.
