# Motivation

Security issues are often easier and less costly to fix when addressed early. Using a SAST tool such as *Gosec* to automatically scan for vulnerabilities is one way to detect common security vulnerabilities before they become a larger problem. 

Furthermore, SAST tools are easily integrated in DevOps pipelines as they can be configured to run automatically every time new code is pushed to a repository, reporting any potential vulnerabilities back to the developers for fixing.

Security can become a bottleneck in traditional DevOps environments when a separate security team has to manually review each new update. This can potentially delay deployment. If we instead integrate security directly into the pipeline we can ensure that deployments meet security standards while still being able to deploy quickly. 

While SAST tools will not detect every possible security vulnerability, they do provide an automated way of catching common vulnerabilities, which can save both time and money.
