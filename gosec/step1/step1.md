# Installation

Before we begin the tutorial, we need to set up a few things. A script is running in the terminal which downloads Go and a few Go projects which we will use to run *gosec* on during this tutorial.

### Installing Gosec

We then need to install *gosec* as well. The command below installs the latest version of *gosec*.

> Run the command by clicking it or by typing it into the terminal.

`go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest`{{exec}}

> Press *check* when the script has finished, the validation will then be successful and take you to the next part of the tutorial. It can take a little while.

`cat $secret `{{exec}}
