# Installation

In order for us to begin with the tutorial we first need a few things. A setup script is running in the console which updates the version of Go and downloads a few Go programs which we will scan for security vulnerabilities.



Finally we will install *gosec*. This can be done in many different ways but one of the easiest ways if you already have Go installed on the system is to run:

go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
