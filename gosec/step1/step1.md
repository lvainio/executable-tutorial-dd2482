# Installation

Before we begin the tutorial, we need to set up a few things. A script is running in the terminal which downloads Go and a few Go projects which we will use to demonstrate *gosec* on during this tutorial.

### Installing Gosec

We then need to install *Gosec* as well. The command below installs the latest version.

> Run the command by clicking it or by typing it into the terminal.

```
go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
```{{exec}}

> Press CHECK when the script has finished. This may take 1-2 minutes. Once complete, the validation will be successful, and you can proceed to the next part of the tutorial.

`cat $secret `{{exec}} =^•ﻌ•^=
