# Installation

Before we begin the tutorial, we need to set up a few things. A script is running in the terminal which downloads Go and a few Go projects which we will use to run *gosec* on during this tutorial.

After the script has finished we need to install *gosec* as well. This can be done in many different ways but one of the easiest ways to do it is to run the script below:

> Run the installation script below by clicking it or by copying it and pasting it into the terminal on the right.

`go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest`{{exec}}

> Please run the installation script above and wait for it to finish, it might take a little while. 

`cat $secret `{{exec}}
