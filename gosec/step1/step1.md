# Installation

Before we begin the tutorial, we need to set up a few things. A script is running in the terminal which downloads Go and a few Go projects which we will use to run *gosec* on during this tutorial.

### Installing Gosec

We then need to install *gosec* as well. This can be done in many different ways but one of the easiest ways to do it is to run the command below.

> Run the command by clicking it or by copying it and pasting it into the terminal.

`go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest`{{exec}}

> Please run the installation script above and wait for it to finish, it might take a little while. Press *check* when it has finished, the validation will then be successful and take you to the next part of the tutorial.

`cat $secret `{{exec}}
