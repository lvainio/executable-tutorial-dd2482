# Installation

In order for us to begin with the tutorial we first need a few things.

First of all we will begin by downloading a few Go programs that we will scan for security vulnerabilities. This is done for you in the background. 

Secondly we will of course need to have go installed in the system, thankfully, this environment already has go installed so no need to install it again. 

Finally we will install *gosec*. This can be done in many different ways but one of the easiest ways if you already have Go installed on the system is to run:

go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
